# lib gECC

## Introduction
This project presents gECC, a versatile framework for ECC optimized for GPU architectures, specifically engineered to achieve high-throughput performance in EC operations. To maximize throughput, gECC incorporates batch-based execution (using Montgomeryâ€™s trick) of EC operations and microarchitecture-level optimization of modular arithmetic.
